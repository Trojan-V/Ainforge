## Backlog

The following features have been thought of already. They are categorized based on their priority.


### Not planned

- ChatNotify: If the hunter is full message appears in chat, send a title message: "Jäger voll!" - I've never been able to see this message appear in chat so far, therefore I can't implement this feature.

- ChatNotify: Send a title message if an epic or legendary blueprint is dropped (it's not possible with ChatNotify, as the only indicator to determine the blueprint rarity is the fomratting code used for the chat message; ChatNotify removes formatting before the messages arrive at the ChatNotify filtering interface)

- FancyMenu: Create a game intro specific to Ainforge

- FancyMenu: Create a custom loading screen using the Drippy Loading Screen addon mod for FancyMenu

- FancyMenu: Test the browser integration coming with the MCEF addon mod for FancyMenu; maybe display the Ainforge changelog with this on the title screen.

- Notes: Notes for the kits are only available in German currently; Add support for other languages as well


### If the community provides the relevant data

- ChatNotify: Add multi-language support for the notifications (The community has to supply the chat messages that are sent in the different languages)


### In the next release

- Go through all mods, resourcepacks and shaderpacks on Modrinth and see if there is anything of interest that might be useful in this modpack.



## Code-specific

- The resource pack that supplies the button textures used on PlayLegend should be released on Modrinth, so it doesn't has to be included as an archive directly in the project. The archive wasn't included in any public release yet, as it first needs confirmation from Gamerstime if the release of it is okay due to the button textures being property of the PlayLegend server.
