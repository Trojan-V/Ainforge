## ChatNotify (Not planned)

- If the hunter is full message appears in chat, send a title message: "Jäger voll"
- Send a title message if an epic or legendary blueprint is dropped (it's not possible with ChatNotify, as the only indicator to determine the blueprint rarity is the fomratting code used for the chat message; ChatNotify removes formatting before the messages arrive at the ChatNotify filtering interface)
- Add multi-language support


## Fancy Menu (Not planned)

- Create an Ainforge-specific game intro
- Create a custom loading screen using the Drippy Loading Screen addon mod
- Test the browser integration coming with the MCEF addon mod


## Notes (Not planned)

- Notes for the kits are only available in German currently; Add support for other languages as well


## New content

- Go through all mods, resourcepacks and shaderpacks on Modrinth and see if there is anything of interest that might be useful in this modpack.


## Code-specific
- The resource pack that supplies the button textures used on PlayLegend should be released on Modrinth, so it doesn't has to be included as an archive directly in the project.
- Discord notification whenever a new release is available

## Vor dem offiziellen Modrinth-Release
